# DESCRIPTION

This is a fork of the pidgin latex plugin. It aims to
refactor and extend it.
The pidgin latex plugin for Pidgin allows you to 
display LaTeX output in your IMs or Chats.

# REQUIREMENTS
	- the pidgin header files (needed to compile the plugin)
	- a LaTex-Distribution
	- dvipng [3]

# IMPORTANT
This plugin is not compatible with gaim-encryption plugin. 
If you have this plugin, please be sure not having the 2 
working at the same time. (for any other imcompability, 
please contact qjuh@users.sourceforge.net )

# BUILDING and INSTALLATION
To build and install :
	You can compile the plugin using
	$ make
	and install it with
	$ make install
	This will install it in ~/.purple/plugins so that only the user who install it can use it.

To install it for everybody on your computer,
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install PREFIX="/path/to/pidgin" (this command as root user)
	generally /path/to/pidgin is /usr or /usr/local. If you don't know the path then you can find out using
	$ whereis pidgin
	and look for the part before "/lib/pidgin".

# USAGE
put LaTeX code into $$ ... $$ markup, for example $$x \in \mathbb{R}$$

# NOTE
To everyone updating from earlier versions than 1.3: you don't need ImageMagick anymore for this plugin to work.
Instead this plugin uses dvipng [3], so please install it, if you don't already have it.
